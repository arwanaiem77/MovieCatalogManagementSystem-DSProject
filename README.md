"# MovieCatalogManagementSystem-DSProject" 
In this project, I developed a Movie Catalog Management System using a Hash Table to store movie information, with AVL Trees used to resolve hash collisions.

The system I built supports the following core functionalities:

Reading movie data from a file.

Inserting new movies into the catalog.

Updating existing movie details.

Deleting movies from the catalog.

Saving the updated catalog back to a file.

Each movie is stored as a key-value pair, where the key is the movie title, and the value contains details such as the description, release year, and rating.

Additionally, I developed a JavaFX Graphical User Interface (GUI) that includes:

A form for entering movie information (add/update).

A list displaying the current movies in the catalog.

A search functionality to find movies by title.

Buttons for deleting movies, saving changes, and importing/exporting data.
Throughout the development process, I focused on implementing an efficient data structure design, providing a user-friendly interface, and ensuring reliable file handling for persistent data storage.
